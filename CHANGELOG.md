# Changelog

## v0.3.0

### Specifications, Keyboard Shortcuts & Mock Device

This release adds live per-range specification display from device manuals, full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and a simulated mock device for testing without hardware. Under the hood, a central device registry simplifies adding new meters, and a large refactoring improves code organization with 282 tests (up from 209).

### GUI

- **Specifications panel** — shows per-range resolution, accuracy (with frequency bands for AC), input impedance, and notes from the device manual. Updates live as the meter changes mode/range. Covers UT61E+, UT61B+, UT61D+, UT161 family, and Mock. Includes "Manual" hyperlink when a URL is configured.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Ctrl+Shift+C` connect, `Space` pause, `Ctrl+L` clear, `Ctrl+R` record, `Ctrl+E` export, `Ctrl+±/0` zoom, `[`/`]` time window, arrows/Home/End graph navigation. Press `?` for in-app reference.
- **Accessibility** — AccessKit labels on icon-only buttons (`?`, gear) and the minimap for screen reader support.
- **Responsive top bar** — wraps to two rows when the window is too narrow.
- **Mock device** — simulated device in the device selector for testing and demos. Cycles through DC V, AC V, Ohms, Capacitance, Hz, Temperature, DC mA, Overload, and NCV. Configurable via "Mock mode" setting. Remote control buttons toggle flags, SELECT advances mode.
- **Device registry** — device selector populated from a central registry. Adding a new device requires zero GUI code changes.
- Display unit now uses the same font size as the measurement value.
- Recording sample values use `display_raw` for stable formatting.

### CLI

- **Mock device** (`--device mock`) — simulated measurements without hardware. Supports `read` (with `--mock-mode` to pin a specific mode) and `command`. Useful for testing output formats and scripting.
- **Device registry** — `--device` flag resolved through central registry. Adding a new device requires zero CLI code changes.
- Validation messaging now directs users to `capture` instead of `debug` for device verification.

### Library

- **Device registry** (`protocol/registry.rs`) — single source of truth for all selectable devices with IDs, aliases, display names, activation instructions, and protocol factory functions.
- **Specification data** — per-range accuracy, resolution, input impedance, and notes for UT61E+, UT61B+, UT61D+, and UT161 family, transcribed from device manuals. Accessible via `lookup_spec()` and `lookup_mode_spec()`.
- **Mock protocol** — `MockProtocol` implementing the `Protocol` trait with configurable scenarios, flag toggling, and mode cycling.
- `Measurement` string fields use `Cow<'static, str>` to avoid heap allocation for static table data.
- `RunningStats` moved to lib crate for reuse across CLI and GUI.
- Shared `read_frame()` helper in framing module.
- Golden tests switched from JSON to capture-compatible YAML format.

### Bug fixes

- Use `checked_duration_since()` instead of `duration_since()` in graph gap detection — prevents panic on backward clock jumps (VM suspend, NTP correction).
- Fix tab order for top bar right-side items (settings gear, help link).
- Fix angle brackets in docs rendered as invisible HTML on GitHub.

### Internal

- Large-scale refactoring: split `app.rs` into focused modules (graph, recording, display, settings, theme, controls), extracted shared helpers, deduplicated test utilities, replaced magic numbers with named constants.
- 282 tests (up from 209 in v0.2.0).

### Documentation

- End-to-end guide for adding device support (`docs/adding-devices.md`).
- Non-UNI-T device candidate research and VC880/VC650BT implementation plan.
- GUI reference, CLI reference, UX design, and architecture docs updated for all new features.
- `dump_specs` example for verifying specification data against manuals.

## v0.2.0

### Multi-Device Protocol Support

Rearchitects the library to support multiple UNI-T multimeter families behind a common Protocol trait.

### New device support

| Family | Models | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **UT61+/UT161** | UT61E+, UT61B+, UT61D+, UT161B/D/E | Verified (UT61E+), device tables for all |
| **UT8803** | UT8803, UT8803E | Experimental — streaming protocol, 21-byte frames |
| **UT171** | UT171A/B/C | Experimental — streaming, float32 values, 26 modes |
| **UT181A** | UT181A | Experimental — streaming, float32 + unit strings, 97 modes |

### CLI

- `--device` flag for selecting device family.
- `command` subcommand accepts free-form command names; run with no args to list available commands per device.
- JSON output includes `"experimental": true/false` field.
- Experimental warning on connect for unverified protocols.
- Device-specific activation instructions shown after 5 consecutive timeouts.

### GUI

- Device selector in settings panel.
- EXPERIMENTAL badge in top bar for unverified protocols.
- Device-dependent remote controls — buttons only shown for supported commands.
- Device name shown in top bar.
- Float value display fallback for protocols without ASCII display strings.

### Library

- `Protocol` trait: `init`, `request_measurement`, `send_command`, `get_name`, `profile`, `capture_steps`.
- Unified `Measurement` type with string-based mode/unit/range fields.
- Shared framing functions for BE16, alternating-byte, 1-byte LE16, and 2-byte LE16 checksums.
- Golden file test infrastructure.
- 209 tests passing.
